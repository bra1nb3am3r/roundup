=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.6.5 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

I'm pleased to announce this maintenance release of Roundup which fixes
some bugs:

- mailgw handles of subject-line errors better
- allow serving of FileClass file content when the class isn't called
  "file" (eg. messages and other FileClasses)
- allowed negative ids (ie. new item markers) in HTMLClass.getItem,
  allowing "db/file_with_status/-1/status/menu" to generate a useful
  widget
- fixed content-type when templates are serving up xml (thanks Godefroid
  Chapelle)
- fixed IE double-submit when it shouldn't (sf bug 842254)
- fixed check for JS pop()/push() to make more general (sf bug 877504)
- fix re-enabling queries (sf bug 861940)
- use supplied content-type on file uploads before trying filename
- fixed roundup-reminder script to use default schema (thanks Klamer Schutte)
- fixed edit action / parsePropsFromForm to handle index-page edits better
- safer logging from HTTP server (sf bug 896917)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation. 

Note that the Zope interface still doesn't work - it is fixed in the 0.7
development codebase.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Python 2.3.1
or later is strongly recommended.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and mysql).

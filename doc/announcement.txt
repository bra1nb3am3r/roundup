=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.5.7 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

This is a bugfix release for version 0.5.x - if you're upgrading from before
0.5, you *must* read doc/upgrading.txt!

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken. If you'd
like to volunteer to fix it, let me know.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Users of the
sqlite backend are encouraged to upgrade sqlite to version 2.7.3.

We've had a good crack at bugs (thanks to all who contributed!):
- fixed Interval maths (sf bug 665357)
- fixed sqlite rollback/caching bug (sf bug 689383)
- fixed rdbms table update detection logic (sf bug 703297)
- fixed detection of bad date specs (sf bug 691439)
- required String properties not being flagged (thanks Ajit George)
- only look for CSV files when importing (thanks Dan Grassi)
- can now unset values in CSV editing (sf bug 704788)
- fixed rdbms email address lookup (case insensitivity)
- email file attachments added to issue files list (sf bug 711501)
- added socket timeout to attempt to prevent stuck processes (sf bug 665487)
- email registered users shouldn't be able to log in (sf bug 714673)
- handle missing addresses on users (sf bug 724537)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and gadfly).

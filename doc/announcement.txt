Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

0.7.9 is a bug fix release (with one feature cleaning up an API
inconsistency):

- DateHTMLProperty.field() accepts format string (thanks Wil Cooley)
- popup listing uses filter args (thanks Marlon van den Berg)
- fixed editing of message contents
- loosened the detection of issue cross-references in messages
- open CSV files in "universal newline" mode
- s/Modifed/Modified (thanks donfu)

  Withers)
- enforce View Permission when serving file content (sf bug 1050470)
- don't index common words (sf bug 1046612)
- set the current username correctly after rego (sf bug 1048398)
- don't wrap query.item.html in a <span> (thanks Roch'e Compaan)
- TAL expressions like 'request/show/whatever' return True
  if the request does not contain explicit @columns list
- NumberHTMLProperty should return '' not "None" if not set (thanks
  William)
- ensure multilink ordering in RDBMS backends (thanks Marcus Priesch, sf
  bug 950963)
- always honor indexme property on Strings (sf patch 1063711)
- make hyperdb value parsing errors readable in mailgw errors
- make anydbm journal export handle removed properties

About Roundup
=============

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and seven database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit, mysql and postgresql).

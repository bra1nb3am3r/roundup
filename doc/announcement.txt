SC-Track Roundup 0.6.4 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

I'm pleased to announce this maintenance release of Roundup which fixes
some bugs:

- fixed date arithmetic to not allow day-of-month == 0 (sf bug 853306)
- fixed date arithmetic to limit hours-per-day to 24, not 60
- fixed activity displaying as future because of Date arithmetic fix in 0.6.3
  (sf bug 842027).
- hard-coded python2.3-ism (socket.timeout) fixed
- fix Windows service mode for roundup-server (sf bug 819890)
- fixed #white in cgitb (thanks Henrik Levkowetz)

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation. 

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Python 2.3.1
or later is strongly recommended.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and mysql).

=================================================
SC-Track Roundup 0.6.2 - an issue tracking system
=================================================

I'm pleased to announce this maintenance release of Roundup which fixes
some bugs:

- cleaned up, clarified internal caching API in *dbm backends
- stopped pyc writing to current directory! yay! (patch 800718 with changes)
- fixed file leak in detector initialisation (patch 800715)
- commented out example tracker homes (patch 800720)
- added note about hidden :template var in user.item (bug 799842)
- fixed change note generation when property was deleted from class and
  we are trying to edit an instance

If you're upgrading from an older version of Roundup you *must* follow
the "Software Upgrade" guidelines given in the maintenance documentation. 

Unfortunately, the Zope frontend for Roundup is currently broken. I hope
to revive it in a future 0.6 maintenance release. No, really.

Roundup requires python 2.1.3 or later for correct operation. Python 2.3.1
or later is strongly recommended.

To give Roundup a try, just download (see below), unpack and run::

    python demo.py

About Roundup
=============

Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with 
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design 
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

Note: Ping is not responsible for this project. The contact for this project 
is richard@users.sourceforge.net.

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as 
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and six database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3, sqlite,
metakit and mysql).

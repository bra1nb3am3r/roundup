Roundup is a simple-to-use and -install issue-tracking system with
command-line, web and e-mail interfaces. It is based on the winning design
from Ka-Ping Yee in the Software Carpentry "Track" design competition.

0.7.7 is a bug fix release, including:

- ZRoundup's search interface works now (sf bug 994957)
- fixed history display when "ascending"
- removed references to py2.3+ boolean values (sf bug 995682)
- fix static file path normalisation in security check (thanks David Linke)
- less specific messages for login failures (thanks Chris Withers)
- Reject raised against email messages should result in email rejection, not
  discarding of the message
- mailgw can override the MAIL_DEFAULT_CLASS
- handle Py2.3+ datetime objects as Date specs (sf bug 971300)
- use row locking in MySQL newid() (sf bug 1034211)
- add sanity check for sort and group on same property (sf bug 1033477)
- extend OTK and session table value cols to TEXT (sf bug 1031271)
- fix lookup of REMOTE_USER (sf bug 1002923)
- new Interval props weren't created properly in rdbms
- date.Interval() now accepts an Interval as a spec (sf bug 1041266)
- handle deleted properties in RDBMS history
- apply timezone in correct direction in user input (sf bug 1013097)
- more efficient find() in RDBMS (sf bug 1012781)
- pydotorg-specific change to mailgw to handle bizzaro permissions ;)

About Roundup
=============

Roundup manages a number of issues (with flexible properties such as
"description", "priority", and so on) and provides the ability to:

(a) submit new issues,
(b) find and edit existing issues, and
(c) discuss issues with other participants.

The system will facilitate communication among the participants by managing
discussions and notifying interested parties when issues are edited. One of
the major design goals for Roundup that it be simple to get going. Roundup
is therefore usable "out of the box" with any python 2.1+ installation. It
doesn't even need to be "installed" to be operational, though a
disutils-based install script is provided.

It comes with two issue tracker templates (a classic bug/feature tracker and
a minimal skeleton) and seven database back-ends (anydbm, bsddb, bsddb3,
sqlite, metakit, mysql and postgresql).
